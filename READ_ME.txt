LookingForJob is a website designed to help people quickly find appropriate job offers.
Jobs are grouped by type(full-time, part-time etc.) and category.
In order to publish a job offer you need to create a company which can be done in "my profile".
The admin panel features a list of all users and makes it possible to edit or delete users as well as giving them admin rights or banning them.
Job offers can't be edited for obvious reasons. Companies and users can only if you're an admin or if you are the user or the company belongs to you.
